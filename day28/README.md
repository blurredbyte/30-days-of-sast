# Day 28: Combining SAST with DAST and IAST for Comprehensive Security

## Summary

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is a powerful tool for finding vulnerabilities by analyzing source code, but it's not a silver bullet. For a more comprehensive application security testing strategy, SAST should be combined with Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) and Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST). Each of these tools has unique strengths and weaknesses, and they complement each other effectively.

### Understanding the Trio:

1.  **SAST (Static Application Security Testing) - "White-box testing"**
    -   **How it works:** Analyzes an application's source code, byte code, or binary code without executing it.
    -   **Pros:**
        -   Finds vulnerabilities early in the SDLC (even before code is compiled or deployed).
        -   Provides exact line numbers for vulnerabilities, aiding remediation.
        -   Can cover 100% of the codebase.
        -   Helps identify issues like dead code, unused variables, and adherence to coding standards.
    -   **Cons:**
        -   Can have a higher rate of false positives if not tuned.
        -   Doesn't understand runtime context, so it can miss vulnerabilities that only appear during execution (e.g., issues related to configuration, environment, or interaction with other services).
        -   May struggle with dynamically typed languages or highly reflective code.
    -   **Typical Vulnerabilities Found:** SQL injection (pattern-based), XSS (pattern-based), buffer overflows, insecure cryptographic usage, hardcoded secrets, race conditions.

2.  **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) - "Black-box testing"**
    -   **How it works:** Tests a running application from the outside by sending various inputs and observing outputs and behavior, much like an attacker would. It has no knowledge of the internal source code.
    -   **Pros:**
        -   Finds runtime vulnerabilities that SAST might miss (e.g., server misconfigurations, authentication/authorization issues, vulnerabilities dependent on user session).
        -   Lower false positive rate for certain vulnerability types as it confirms exploitability.
        -   Language and framework agnostic (tests the running application).
    -   **Cons:**
        -   Cannot pinpoint the exact line of code causing the vulnerability.
        -   Typically covers only the parts of the application that are exercised by the tests/scanner.
        -   Requires a running application, so findings occur later in the SDLC.
        -   Can be slow, as it needs to crawl and attack the application.
        -   May struggle with complex application flows or applications requiring specific states.
    -   **Typical Vulnerabilities Found:** XSS (reflected, stored, DOM), SQL injection (error-based, boolean-based, time-based), CSRF, insecure HTTP headers, path traversal, command injection (if observable), open redirects.

3.  **IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing) - "Grey-box testing"**
    -   **How it works:** Combines elements of SAST and DAST. It uses instrumentation within the running application (often via agents) to monitor data flows and execution paths while interacting with the application (either through manual testing or DAST scans).
    -   **Pros:**
        -   Provides runtime context, leading to more accurate results and lower false positives than SAST.
        -   Can pinpoint the exact line of code like SAST, thanks to instrumentation.
        -   Identifies vulnerabilities that are actually exploitable in the runtime environment.
        -   Can trace data flows through the application, including across tiers or microservices (depending on the IAST solution).
        -   Works well in agile and DevOps environments as it provides feedback during testing phases.
    -   **Cons:**
        -   Requires instrumentation, which can add some overhead to the application.
        -   Coverage depends on the parts of the application exercised during testing.
        -   Can be more complex to set up and configure than SAST or some DAST tools.
        -   Language/platform support can be a limiting factor.
    -   **Typical Vulnerabilities Found:** SQL injection (with code location), XSS (with code location), command injection, path traversal, insecure cryptographic operations, access control issues.

### Why Combine Them? The "Defense in Depth" Approach

-   **Complementary Strengths:**
    -   SAST finds issues early and provides code-level detail.
    -   DAST finds runtime issues and confirms exploitability from an external perspective.
    -   IAST bridges the gap, offering runtime analysis with code-level insights.
-   **Broader Vulnerability Coverage:** Different tools are better at finding different types of vulnerabilities. Combining them increases the chances of catching a wider range of security flaws.
-   **Reduced False Positives/Negatives:** Findings from one tool can help validate or invalidate findings from another. For example, if SAST flags a potential SQLi, DAST or IAST might be able to confirm if it's exploitable.
-   **Contextual Understanding:** IAST, in particular, helps connect static code findings with actual runtime behavior.

### Strategy for Combining SAST, DAST, and IAST:

1.  **SAST in Development:**
    -   Integrate into IDEs for real-time feedback.
    -   Run on every commit/PR in CI/CD for rapid checks.
    -   Focus on high-confidence rules and critical vulnerabilities.

2.  **DAST in QA/Staging:**
    -   Run automated DAST scans against deployed applications in testing environments.
    -   Perform DAST as part of integration testing and user acceptance testing (UAT).
    -   Useful for identifying issues related to configuration and deployment.

3.  **IAST during QA/Testing:**
    -   Deploy IAST agents in QA or testing environments.
    -   Leverage existing functional tests, integration tests, or manual exploratory testing to drive IAST analysis.
    -   Provides detailed, accurate findings with code context.

4.  **Correlate Findings:**
    -   Use Application Security Orchestration and Correlation (ASOC) tools or platforms to ingest results from SAST, DAST, IAST, and other security tools.
    -   Correlate and deduplicate findings to get a unified view of application risk.

5.  **Feedback Loops:**
    -   Feed DAST/IAST findings back to developers with as much context as possible to help them understand how vulnerabilities manifest at runtime.
    -   Use insights from DAST/IAST to refine SAST rules or develop new custom SAST rules.

### Conclusion

While SAST is an essential foundation for application security, relying on it alone provides an incomplete picture. By strategically combining SAST with DAST and IAST, organizations can achieve a more robust, multi-layered security testing strategy. This "defense in depth" approach significantly improves vulnerability detection capabilities and helps build more secure software by leveraging the unique strengths of each testing methodology throughout the SDLC.

This day is for understanding these testing methodologies and how they can work together. No specific code examples are required.
