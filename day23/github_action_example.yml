        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # --- Option 1: Semgrep Scan (Conceptual - for full example see .github/workflows/semgrep_scan.yml) ---
      # This uses the official Semgrep action.
      # You might configure it with your Semgrep App token for dashboard reporting
      # or use specific local/registry rules.
      - name: Run Semgrep (Example)
        if: false # Disabled by default, enable to test this section
        uses: returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1
        with:
          # config: "p/default" # Use a known ruleset, e.g., from the Semgrep registry
          # For example, to scan Python code with default Python rules:
          config: "p/python"
          # To generate a SARIF file for GitHub Security tab integration:
          generateSarif: true
          # Optionally fail the build based on severity
          # failOnSeverity: ERROR # or WARNING, INFO

      # --- Option 2: Basic CodeQL Scan (Conceptual - for full setup see GitHub CodeQL docs) ---
      # CodeQL setup is more involved and typically uses github/codeql-action/init, autobuild, and analyze.
      - name: Initialize CodeQL (Example - simplified)
        if: false # Disabled by default, enable to test this section
        uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
        with:
          languages: javascript # Specify the language(s) of your project (e.g., javascript, python, java)
          # queries: +security-and-quality # Example query suite

      - name: Autobuild (Example - for compiled languages, if needed by CodeQL)
        if: false # Disabled by default, enable to test this section
        # For languages like Java, C++, C#, Go, you'd need a build step.
        # For interpreted languages like Python, JavaScript, this might not be strictly necessary
        # or might be handled differently by the CodeQL action.
        # uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v2
        # Example for a JavaScript project (often no explicit build needed for SAST)
        run: echo "Simulating build step if necessary for CodeQL"

      - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis (Example - simplified)
        if: false # Disabled by default, enable to test this section
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
        with:
          # category: "/language:javascript" # Ensure this matches the language initialized

      # --- Option 3: Running a generic linter/SAST tool via script (Conceptual) ---
      # This is how you might run a tool not covered by a dedicated GitHub Action.
      - name: Run Custom SAST Tool (Example)
        if: false # Disabled by default
        run: |
          echo "Installing and running a custom SAST tool..."
          # Example: pip install some-sast-tool
          # some-sast-tool --output results.sarif --fail-on-critical ./
          # Or if it doesn't produce SARIF, handle its output format.
          echo "Custom SAST tool finished."
          # if [ -s "error_report.txt" ]; then exit 1; fi

      - name: Upload SARIF to GitHub Security Tab (if generated)
        if: false # Only run if a SARIF file was generated by a previous step
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          # Path to SARIF file (e.g., results.sarif, semgrep.sarif)
          # Ensure the filename matches what your SAST tool produces.
          sarif_file: semgrep.sarif # Adjust if using Semgrep with generateSarif: true
          # Or for CodeQL, it's often automatically handled by the analyze action if correctly configured.
          # sarif_file: ../results/results.sarif # Default for CodeQL if not customized

    outputs:
      scan_completed: true

  # You could have a subsequent job that depends on the SAST scan
  # For example, a deployment job that only runs if sast_scan was successful.
  # deploy:
  #   needs: sast_scan
  #   if: success() # Only run if sast_scan job succeeded
  #   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  #   steps:
  #     - name: Deploy
  #       run: echo "Deploying to production..."
