# Day 26: SAST Best Practices

## Summary

Successfully implementing Static Application Security Testing (SAST) goes beyond just running a tool. It requires a strategic approach to integrate SAST into your development lifecycle effectively, manage its findings, and foster a security-conscious culture. Today, we'll summarize some best practices for getting the most out of your SAST program.

---

### 1. Integrate Early and Often (Shift Left)
-   **CI/CD Integration:** Automate SAST scans within your CI/CD pipeline (as discussed on Day 23). Run scans on every commit, pull request, or merge to the main branch.
-   **IDE Integration:** Provide developers with SAST tools or plugins directly in their Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for immediate feedback as they code.
-   **Pre-Commit Hooks:** For very fast checks, consider running lightweight SAST scans (e.g., Semgrep with a small, critical ruleset) as a pre-commit hook.

### 2. Start Small and Iterate
-   **Pilot Program:** Begin with a critical application or a new project to fine-tune processes before a full-scale rollout.
-   **Focused Rulesets:** Initially, use a limited set of high-confidence, high-impact rules to avoid overwhelming developers with findings. Gradually expand coverage.
-   **Baseline Strategically:** For existing applications, establish a baseline of current findings. Focus initially on fixing new vulnerabilities introduced in new code. Plan to address the backlog of existing findings over time.

### 3. Customize and Tune Your Rules
-   **Reduce False Positives:** Actively manage false positives (Day 25). Tune existing rules, disable noisy ones, and create custom rules tailored to your codebase, frameworks, and known safe patterns.
-   **Develop Custom Rules:** Identify common mistakes or framework-specific vulnerabilities in your organization and write custom SAST rules to detect them (Day 22).
-   **Severity Calibration:** Adjust the severity of findings based on your organization's risk appetite and the actual impact of the vulnerability in your specific context.

### 4. Prioritize and Manage Findings
-   **Risk-Based Prioritization:** Focus on fixing the most critical vulnerabilities first. Consider factors like CVSS score, exploitability, business impact, and location in critical code.
-   **Integrate with Issue Trackers:** Automatically create tickets (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) for SAST findings, assigning them to the appropriate teams or developers.
-   **Set Remediation SLAs:** Define Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for fixing vulnerabilities based on their severity.
-   **Track Metrics:** Monitor key metrics like scan frequency, number of findings, fix rates, and false positive rates to measure effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.

### 5. Educate and Empower Developers
-   **Training:** Provide developers with secure coding training and education on common vulnerability types relevant to their work. Help them understand SAST findings and how to remediate them.
-   **Developer Buy-in:** Involve developers in the SAST tool selection and rule-tuning process. Make them partners in security.
-   **Clear Remediation Guidance:** Ensure SAST findings include clear explanations of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and actionable remediation advice. Link to secure coding guidelines.
-   **Security Champions:** Establish a security champions program where developers with an interest in security can help promote best practices and assist their peers.

### 6. Combine SAST with Other Security Activities
-   **Defense in Depth:** SAST is not a silver bullet. Complement it with:
    -   **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing):** Tests running applications for vulnerabilities.
    -   **IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing):** Combines elements of SAST and DAST.
    -   **SCA (Software Composition Analysis):** Identifies vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    -   **Manual Code Reviews:** For critical components or complex logic.
    -   **Penetration Testing:** Simulates real-world attacks.
    -   **Threat Modeling:** Proactively identifies potential threats and weaknesses.

### 7. Regularly Review and Update
-   **Tool & Rule Updates:** Keep your SAST tool and its rule definitions up to date to cover new vulnerability types and improve detection accuracy.
-   **Process Review:** Periodically review your SAST processes, metrics, and developer feedback to identify opportunities for improvement.
-   **Adapt to Changes:** As your applications, technologies, and threat landscape evolve, adapt your SAST strategy accordingly.

### 8. Foster a Positive Security Culture
-   **Blameless Reporting:** Focus on fixing issues, not blaming individuals.
-   **Collaboration:** Encourage collaboration between development, security, and operations teams (DevSecOps).
-   **Celebrate Successes:** Recognize teams and individuals for their contributions to improving application security.

By following these best practices, organizations can transform SAST from a simple scanning activity into a powerful, integrated component of their software development lifecycle, leading to more secure applications and a stronger overall security posture.

This day is for understanding and applying these principles. No specific code examples are required.
