## How to Use This Repository

Each day's folder (`day01` to `day30`) contains:
- A `README.md` with the lesson details, commands, and code explanations.
- Example source code files (`example.c`, `sample.py`, etc.).
- (If applicable) Semgrep rules (`semgrep-rule.yaml`) or CodeQL queries (`query.ql`).

Follow along with the blog posts and use the materials in each folder to practice the concepts.

Happy learning!
